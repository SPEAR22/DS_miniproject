"Multiplayer game - Enter the number closest to the average" server.py file

This script is responsible for the server. It can only be run on one terminal. 
The next launch of it will result in the error "Only one usage of each socket address 
(protocol / network address / port) is normally permitted".

The server side is responsible for the state of the game, player support, storing the 
results, and appropriate response to errors. The server displays on the terminal the 
appropriate activities that it performs in relation to individual players

This script requires 'socket', 'time', 'threading', 'array' modules

This file contains the following functions:

    * checkconnectionwithclient
    * handleclient
    * informclient
    * handleroundwithclient
    * checkresults
    * closeconnectionwithclients
    * handlenewconnection
